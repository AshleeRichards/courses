				New Zealand is a sovereign island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmasses—the North Island (Te Ika-a-Māui), and the South Island (Te Waipounamu)—and around 600 smaller islands.
      </br></br>
        I was fortunate enough to call Auckland home for over a year, and look forward to sharing the country's hidden gems with you all.

        <h3>From Tents to Resorts... and everything in between</h3>
        <p>
          New Zealand is full of wonderful places to stay. You have the ability to sleep in the outdoors in a tent, a star-gazing glass-enclosed Pure Pod, or relax like a king at a five star resort. Here are my top three recomendations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#hotels">Tawharanui Peninsula Campground</a></li>
          <li><a href="#resorts">Pure Pod New Zealand</a></li>
          <li><a href="#lodging">Queenstown Hotel</a></li>

        <h3>Pack Accordingly</h3>
        <p>
          New Zealand is home to every type of climate and environment one can imagine. You need to prepare for a range of temperatures and conditions. Here are a few tips:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Bring layers of clothing</li>
          <li>Pack sunscreen (seriously!)</li>
          <li>Always carry a rainjacket</li>
          <li>Wear sturdy footwear</li>
        </ol>
